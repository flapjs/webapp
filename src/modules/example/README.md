# ExampleModule
Welcome to the example tutorial module.

## Motivation
You should always read the README first. Usually
there is something interesting (or pitfalls) in
there that the developer wants you to know. And
because of that, YOU should write one too for
your module. Be sure to explain not only what it
does, but also why we are building it and what
it is intended for.

## Setup
Before you go off and start making your module, you
need to add your module into the `ModuleRegistry.js`.
This is how the Flap.js root application is able to
select your module and load it.

## Usage
Now on to the good stuff. Head over to
`ExampleService.js` to begin.
